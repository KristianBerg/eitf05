Set up (Windows)

1. Install WAMP Server (x86 if on 32-bit system and preferably but not necessarily x64 if on 64-bit system).

2. Start WAMP Server and hopefully the taskbar icon will turn green.

SETTING UP ALIASES:

3. Left-click on the taskbar icon and then press Apache > Alias directories > Add and alias.

4. A terminal window will appear, input "store" on the first question. Input location of the git folder, 
for example "C:\Users\Name\Desktop\eitf05\php files".

5. Repeat step 3 and 4 but change the inputs in step 4 to "weakStore" and the second should end with "\weak php" instead of "\php files".

SETTING UP THE SQL DATABASE:

6. Open up a browser of your choice and write "localhost/phpmyadmin" in address field.

7. Log in with username "root" and leave the password field empty.

8. Press the "new" database in the toolbar containing a list of databases on the left-hand side to create a new database, name it "eitf05".

9. Tab back to the git main folder and open the file "SQL_Queries.txt", copy everything by pressing first "ctrl+a" and then "ctrl+c".

10. Tab back to the browser, press the "eitf05" located directly underneath "new" in the list of databases.

11. Press the SQL tab in the top middle of the window. Paste the SQL queries into the big text field by pressing "ctrl+v" 
and then press the "Go" button below the text field on the right.

ENJOYING THE SITE:

12. The site should now be up and running. Head over there by writing "localhost/store" or "localhost/weakStore" and sign up!
